# mini_data_analysis2_jiameng_lan
As last repository cannot be linked to local (it keeps showing "no branch"), this new repository was set up to test if local directory can have "push" work normally. And this one works, so this would be the final repository.
This repository is the same as before.

This repository is for STAT545A course. It contains two mini data analysis assignments. Both the assignments use the flow_sample data in datateachr. 
The assignments are investigating some research questions related to the flow data over the months or years. 
Please load tidyverse and datateachr to engage with the assignments.
This repository contains Milestone1, Milestone2, output folders as assignments asked, the rest folder and file are for recording the update of commits.
